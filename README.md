## Elara Hub

> ⚠️ **Note:** This repository is **archived** and will not be updated any longer, as a more up-to-date version of Elara hub has been directly integrated into the [Project Elara website repository](https://github.com/elaraproject/elaraproject.github.io).

This is like a Notion space for Project Elara. See the site at <https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub>, or begin editing the files in [content/](./content).

To develop, install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and then run `zola serve`, then start developing!
