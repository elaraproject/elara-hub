## Quick notes

For the elara handbook images - use this template:

```md

:alt: Free body diagram single force
:width: 400px
:align: center
```

Elara UI/UX guidelines: high accessibility, visual comfort, and clarity are the main priorities.

Project Elara research papers should use literate programming to ensure reproducible research, like org-mode. They should be written in a specialized markdown syntax with support for executable code blocks (like MyST markdown), which is then compiled to LaTeX and HTML (with the Elara academic theme). Design the Elara academic theme in Figma.
