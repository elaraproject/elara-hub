Project Elara is founded on a few key ideas. First, we have a fervent desire to make the world better - and not just a little bit better, we want to make a world that we could only dream of today, a world as close to the ideal as possible. But of course, we know that for a small group of people, accomplishing such lofty goals isn't going to be easy. So we follow a cathedral-style workflow: what can't be finished in one generation will be carried on by the next generation, and then the next, until one day, the work is finished.

Second, we want to stay true to the project's ideals far into the future. This entails that the hands to steer the project must always be our own. The project is also designed to be resilient, to resist outside influences, and to be as self-sufficient as possible. It is not bound to any physical location, country, or government, all its software and hardware are free and open-source, and the project's main publications can all be read offline. In addition, we try to stay away from depending on large organizations - while we may not have as many resources, we can work with less bureaucracy hindering our progress.

Finally, we want the project to be representative of all humanity. So the project's community is meant to be safe, inclusive, and accepting and built on kindness and respect. It is understanding of everything except intolerance, but it will not tolerate any intolerance.
