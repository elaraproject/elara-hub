title = "6-month roadmap 1"
+++

## Overview

Currently what is necessary is to make progress on both the theoretical and experimental fronts. On the theoretical front, detailed computer simulations and models should be made. On the experimental front, the first implementation should be well underway within 6 months.

## 6-month goals

- Research goals
	- Complete a third paper of full research paper length (12-15 pages)
	- Complete designs of the transmitter and receiver such that the individual components are ready to test, and whenever possible, perform computer simulations on each component
	- Begin in-lab experimentation and demonstrate concrete results
- Project goals
	- Recruit at least an additional 5 members
	- Get at least one more benefactor, member of faculty, or consultative advisor on board
	- Establish a unified project front and clear project organization

## Tasklist

Given the established 6-month goals, the following tasks must be completed. Note that this task list may be added to, but primarily for the purpose of clarification/expanding detail, and it is best not to remove any items from this task list.
