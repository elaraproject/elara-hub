title = "Project Elara Outreach Plan"

Fundamental issues:

- Must reach critical threshold of ~15-25 people to be able to start getting attention
- Then we can present our work to a larger audience (e.g. SPS, official events, etc.) and get more people to join
- With a bigger team we can build more advanced prototypes and have more results that we can then use to recruit more people - positive feedback loop above critical threshold
- Also other options:
	- [[Project Elara Visualization-based outreach]](@/visualization-outreach.md)
	- Software-based outreach (marketing the elara libraries as part of the project)
- However to get to 15-25 people we must use direct outreach

Use DALL-E/Midjourney/Stable Diffusion to create youtube videos/website photos/poster images for Project Elara, and I'll compose the musical background music for the videos.
