Refer to the following table for conversions from the SI system of units to the geometrized unit system. To convert an SI unit to the geometrized unit, multiply the SI value by the first column; to convert a geometrized unit to an SI unit, multiply the geometrized value by the second column.

| Measure of... | SI to geometrized | Geometrized to SI |
|-----|-----|------|
| Length ($L$) | $\frac{c^2}{G}$ | $\frac{G}{c^2}$ |
| Time ($T$) | $\frac{1}{c}$ | $c$|
| Mass ($M$) | 1 (same value in SI and geometrized) | 1 (same value in SI and geometrized) |

All other measurements can be built out of these base units for length, time, and mass. For example, force has the dimension $M LT^{-2}$ , so SI to geometrized would be multiplying by $\frac{c^2}{G}c^2=\frac{c^4}{G}$, and geometrized to SI would be multiplying by $\frac{G}{c^4}$.
