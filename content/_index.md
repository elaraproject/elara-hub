# Welcome to Elara Hub!

Elara Hub is Project Elara’s knowledge base and project management tool. Or more simply, it’s where most of the work of the project is done! In keeping with the project ideals, Elara Hub is open-source and fully accessible.

It uses plaintext markdown files that are easy to write. It supports all the standard markdown features, including tables, math, images, code highlighting, etc. There is an optional menu but it is not required for reading the Elara Hub, because all pages are connected with internal links.
