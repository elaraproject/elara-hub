The Elara Hub uses a special formatting language to generate its website. This formatting language is called Elara markdown, and is a dialect of markdown. Like markdown files, they end with the `.md` extension. An overview of the syntax is given below.

## Basic syntax

Inline text formatting is accomplished with `_italics_` (or `*this italic format*`) and `**bold**`. You can creating headings using `#` symbols - H2 is `##`, H3 is `###`, and so on. Note that on Elara Hub we don't use H1's because that is reserved for title text, and the title is auto-generated on build. Horizontal dividers are created with three dashes - that is, `---`.
