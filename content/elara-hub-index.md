## The Vision

Project Elara is a unified mission of many committed people to share knowledge, improve the lives of others, and gift our work to the world.

We want to create **a world worthy of human dignity** through the spirit of collaboration and openness.

We gather people together to work on **open research and open technologies** that benefit everyone.

We want to inspire hope that we as individuals have the power together to do **incredible things**.

> "Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do."
