Make a youtube channel containing cool raytraced visualizations of black holes, planets, stars, nebulae, galaxies, alien landscapes, wormholes and such to get people interested - see:

[[Black hole raytracing]](@/black-hole-raytracing.md)

Combine custom Python scripting (for numerically integrating ODEs/PDEs) and a custom (GPU shader based) pathtracer written in `elara-gfx` to make realistic black hole/star/planet simulations. The actual models can be made in Blender/scripted from math, they're just rendered with a dedicated Project Elara renderer.
