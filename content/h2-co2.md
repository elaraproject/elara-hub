$$
6CO_2 + 6 H_2 O \Rightarrow C_6 H_{12} O_6 + 6 O_2
$$

$$
C_6 H_{12} O_6 \Rightarrow 6H_2 + 6C + 3O_2
$$
The idea is that solid carbon can then be stored, hydrogen gas can be used for fuel cells. And in giant vertical towers full of organisms that do this reaction, mass carbon sequestration could be accomplished.
