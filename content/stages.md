The project is divided into three big phases, each characterized by reaching a milestone:

- Elara One
- Elara Two
- Elara Three

Of these, Elara One is the current focus, as it won't be complete for another 50 years.

Elara One plans are as follows:

| Stage | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| Stage One | Initial prototype power generation |
| Stage Two | Ion propulsion and independent maneuvering capability |
| Stage Three | Automated robotic repair spacecraft |
| Stage Four | Space assembly; from this point on smaller rockets will be used |
| Stage Five | Automated thruster refueling in space |

After the first 5 keystone stages, launches will take place from all over the world at an increasing rate, with an anticipated 100 launches a year. This will pave the way for the elimination of fossil fuel power plants within the same timeframe. Within the span of 30-40 years, all fossil fuel plants should be decommissioned.
