to Elara Hub!\nElara Hub is Project Elara’s knowledge base and project management tool. Or more simply, it’s where most of the work of the project is done! In keeping with the project ideals, Elara Hub is open-source and developed together by the community.\nWhat is this for?\nThink of this as a mixed community wiki/collaboration tool for the project. We organize things, plan things, write down notes, discuss project direction, and share knowledge with each other here. Everything is written using plaintext markdown files that are then automatically compiled into a website (which can both be viewed online and locally if working offline). \nThe interface is designed to be as simple and minimal as possible. Just read through each page, and navigate by the internal links in each page. The sidebar menu (and on mobile, the top menu) provide another way to quickly and easily switch files.\nQuick start\nYou probably want to read the [index page] first, from which you can go to any other page via the internal links. The index page is also easily accessible via the \"Home\" link in the left sidebar menu (on desktop) or top menu (on mobile).\nEditing guide\nTo get started, first install Zola. Also ensure you have Git installed. Then clone the Elara Hub repository:\ngit clone https://github.com/elaraproject/elara-hub.git\ncd elara-hub\n\nWithin that folder, run zola serve. You should see a local web address pop up - open that address in your browser, the site gives you a live preview as you edit. Then simply open the desired files in the content/ folder, and begin editing!\nElara Hub is written in a plaintext format called markdown. If you're not familiar with it, that's okay! Just see the [markdown guide].\nWhen adding new files, make sure to add internal links to that new file to at least one other markdown file. This ensures navigability! Internal links follow the format [[File name]](@/path-to-file.md), with the extra bracket differentiating them from web links.\nImportant to note: do not run a production build with zola build, always use zola serve when editing/viewing files locally for live preview. The production build appends the GitHub pages base url, meaning it does not work offline anymore. In addition, make sure your editor is configured to use spaces, not tabs, when editing code blocks! Otherwise they render oddly.\nThe site is easiest to edit with a code editor that has a command palette-style fuzzy-matching filepicker or fzf support.\nTechnical notes\nAll the standard markdown features are supported, including tables, math, images, code highlighting, etc. There is an optional menu but it is not required for reading the Elara Hub, because all pages are connected with internal links. The site is statically-generated by Zola and uses almost no JavaScript.\nFAQs\n\nWhy no PDF version?\n\nFor several reasons. First, PDFs are very hard to make accessible, and are not really responsive. Second, the internal link system used by Elara Hub is hard to translate into PDF format.

The general form of a PDE is:\n$$\nF \\left(x, y, \\dots, f(x, y), \\dots\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}, \\dots \\frac{\\partial^n f}{\\partial x^n}, \\frac{\\partial^n f}{\\partial y^n} \\dots \\right) = G(x, y, \\dots)\n$$\nTo shorten derivatives, we often use the $\\nabla$ symbol, where:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 u = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\nSome specific examples of PDEs include the heat equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\alpha^2 \\nabla^2 u\n$$\nThe wave equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\nabla^2 u\n$$\nAnd Poisson's equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 u = f\n$$\nPDEs can have many, many solutions. For instance, take the PDE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0\n$$\nThe general solution of this PDE is $u(x, y) = xf(y) + g(y)$. And yes, those can be any functions of $y$, whether they be $e^y$ or $y \\sin(y)$ or $y + 3y - \\sqrt{y}$. Thus, just like ODEs need initial conditions to give unique solutions, PDEs need boundary conditions to give unique solutions. The typical set of boundary conditions for a PDE are values at the edges of the domain of the PDE (e.g. $u(x, t) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$). When the PDE is dependent on time, then the boundary condition for $t \\to 0$ is often called an initial condition - remember, for PDEs, initial conditions are considered a type of boundary condition.\nNumerically solving PDEs\nThe most common methods of solving PDEs numerically are the finite difference, finite element, and boundary element methods.\nEncode derivatives as matrices - take wave equation as example. We have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nWe want to discretize the second partial derivative. Recall that:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\approx \\frac{u(x - h, t) + 2u(x, t) + u(x + h)}{h^2}\n$$\nOr, alternatively written:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\approx \\frac{u_{i - 1, j} + 2u_{i, j} + u_{i + 1, j}}{h^2}\n$$\nThis works in all cases except at the left and right boundaries of the domain, as there is not another point to the left of the boundary to take the central difference. Instead, we use the single-sided difference - for the left, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{2u_{i, j} - 5u_{i+ 1, j} + 4u_{i + 2, j} - u_{i+3, j}}{h^2}\n$$\nAnd for the right, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{-u_{i-3, j} + 4u_{i - 2, j} - 5u_{i - 1, j} + 2u_{i, j}}{h^2}\n$$\nNote: see https://web.media.mit.edu/~crtaylor/calculator.html for a calculator for these values (enter 0, 1, 2, 3 for the left-handed 2nd derivative and -3, -2, -1, 0 for the right-handed 2nd derivative).\nNow, partial derivatives are linear operators, just like matrices. So we can spatially discretize the equation by turning the 2nd spatial partial derivative into a matrix $A$ acting on the solution vector $U$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = AU\n$$\nWhere:\n$$\nAU=\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 &amp; -5 &amp; 4 &amp; -1 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\\n1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\\n&amp; 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\\n&amp; &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\\\\n&amp; &amp; &amp; 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 1 &amp; \\\\\n&amp; &amp; -1 &amp; 4 &amp; -5 &amp; 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nu_{1, 1} \\\\\nu_{1, 2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nu_{1, n - 1} \\\\\nu_{1, n} \\\\\nu_{2, 1} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nu_{m, n}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n2u_{1, 1} -5 u_{1, 2} + 4 u_{1, 3} - u_{1, 4} \\\\\nu_{1, 3} - 2u_{1, 2} + u_{1, 1} \\\\\nu_{1, 4} - 2u_{1, 3} + u_{1, 2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\nu_{i, 1} - 5u_{i, 2} + 4u_{i, 3} - u_{i, 4} \\\\\nu_{i, 3} - 2u_{i, 2} + u_{i, 1} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\nu_{i, n} - 2u_{i, n - 1} + u_{i, n - 1} \\\\\n-u_{i, n - 3} + 4u_{i, n - 2} -5u_{i, n - 1} + 2u_{i, n}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nBy discretizing the spatial derivative, the partial time derivative simply becomes an ordinary time derivative. Thus we can rewrite as:\n$$\nU'' = c^2 AU\n$$\nWhich is an ordinary differential equation that can be solved with conventional ODE solvers. The only thing left is to compute an initial condition $U_0(x)$ and $U_0'(x)$ (if you know the initial condition you can differentiate it to get the initial time derivative).\nThis method works well even in the higher-dimensional case. For instance, consider the generalized wave equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\nabla^2 u\n$$\nBy encoding the Laplacian $\\nabla^2 u$ as a matrix $A$ acting on $U$, the same approach can be used as with the other approaches previously mentioned. In fact, this approach works for all linear partial differential equations that have one time and one or several space derivatives.\nFor other cases of linear PDEs that are not time-based, such as Poisson's or Laplace's equation, they can be generally written in the form:\n$$\nAU = B\n$$\nAnd solved using standard linear algebra techniques.\nFinally, for nonlinear PDEs, they can be generally written in the form:\n$$\nAU - f(U) = 0\n$$\nWhich is a rootfinding problem that can be solved with Newton's method:\n$$\nU_{i + 1} = U_{i} - J^{-1}U(x_0)\n$$\nSources\n\nhttps://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1438836/FULLTEXT01.pdf\nhttps://youtu.be/hxGA1Je1P-s\nhttps://github.com/lukepolson/youtube_channel/blob/main/Python%20GPU/schrodinger.ipynb\nhttps://gist.github.com/c0rychu/6fc08cf5cdec2cc78a1f9334d103a869#file-schrodingereq_1d_tutorial-ipynb\nhttps://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/221207/finite-difference-method-for-1d-wave-equation\nhttps://nextjournal.com/sosiris-de/pde-2018\nhttps://empossible.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Lecture-4a-Finite-Difference-Method.pdf\nhttps://aquaulb.github.io/book_solving_pde_mooc/solving_pde_mooc/notebooks/01_Introduction/01_00_Preface.html\n\nElara-math integration\nIn the future, the differential equation solver RK4 will be ported from elara-array to elara-math. elara-math will then have two differential equations solver classes - odesolve, which solves (singular or systems of) ordinary differential equations, and pdesolve for (singular or systems of) partial differential equations.

For example, the first two of Maxwell's equations result in 2 trivial equations. The second two are more complex, as the curl of a vector field produces another vector field. Thus, we must instead rewrite the curl component-by-component. The complete equations are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial t}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial t}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial t}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial z} = \\mu_0 \\left(J_x + \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial t}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial x} = \\mu_0 \\left(J_y + \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial t}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial B_x}{\\partial y} =\\mu_0 \\left(J_z + \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial t}\\right)\n$$\nSo Maxwell's equations result in 8 coupled PDEs. However, only 6 of them are independent - any system that satisfies the last 6 PDEs also must satisfy the first 2, so long as the boundary conditions satisfy the conservation of charge.\nHere, note that for a solution, the current density must be set, which consists of one function each for $J_x, J_y, J_z$.\nCommon PDEs\nWave equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\nabla^2 u\n$$\nHeat/diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha^2 \\nabla^2 T\n$$\nLaplace's equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 u = 0\n$$\nPoisson's equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 u = f(u)\n$$\nBurger's equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + c \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nContinuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot u = 0\n$$\nNavier-Stokes:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot u = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\rho \\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + (u \\cdot \\nabla) u\\right) = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 u + \\rho g\n$$\nMaxwell's equations:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot E = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot B = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla \\times E = -\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial t}\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla \\times B = \\mu_0 \\left(J + \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t}\\right)\n$$\nEinstein's field equations:\n$$\nG_{\\mu \\nu} = \\frac{8\\pi G}{c^4} T_{\\mu \\nu}\n$$\nEquations of quantum mechanics:\n\nSchrödinger equation\nPauli equation\nKlein-Gordon equation\nDirac equation\n\nEuler-Lagrange equations, Hamilton's equations\nBlack-Scholes equation\n","id":"https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub/all-about-pdes/","title":"All about partial differential equations"},"https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub/alt-de-solver/":{"body":"\"New\" way to solve ODEs and PDEs that DOESN'T involve complicated computations or matrices (actually not new at all, but it might have potential):\nJust use Taylor series and automatic differentiation. Consider, for example, the ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = 3y + 2x^2, y(0) = 3\n$$\n$$\ny'' = 3y' + 4x, y' = 9\n$$\n$$\ny''' = 3y'' + 4, y'' = 27\n$$\n$$\ny''' = 3y''', y''=85\n$$\nYou can construct a Taylor series around the point $x = 0$ to approximate a solution $y(x)$ of the ODE, then use automatic differentiation to compute successive derivatives to refine that approximation. This approach doesn't have numerical precision errors, and it can be made arbitrarily precise, and also doesn't require complicated grids. And it can be extended for partial differential equations - you do the same, just with the partial derivatives version of Taylor series. And this works on all analytic functions, even non-elementary functions, so it's especially well-suited to arbitrary differential equations. The solver can use the Taylor remainder theorem to automatically choose the number of terms for the approximation to be within a specified maximum error tolerance.\nFor the Taylor series to be maximally accurate even at points far from the source, multiple taylor series is used. A new point $x_1$ is chosen based on the most distant point from the original point $x_0$ that satisfies the maximum error as defined by the Taylor remainder theorem. Then a new taylor series is constructed from the point $x_1$. This process can be repeated multiple times to generate an effective solution for all points requested.\n(Note: there are definitely optimizations that can be done to make the Taylor series converge faster while retaining the same algorithm for ODE/PDE solving, but that is for another time.)\nWays to speed up taylor series approx to diff eq:\n\nComputing more terms\nRange reduction\nUsing multiple overlapping taylor series computed by constructing a new taylor series from a point evaluated by an existing one\n\nNote that multiple overlapping taylor series isn't runge kutta or euler because it computes derivatives of the derivative via autodiff, instead of using a single derivative.\n\nTo create a very basic implementation of this method and show that it solves a first-order ODE accurately, I will use a dual-number based autodiff. So the code will be like this:\nstruct Num {\n    pub val: f64,\n    pub eps: f64,\n}\n\nimpl Num {\n    fn from(val: f64, eps: f64) -&gt; Num {\n        Value {\n            val, eps\n        }\n    }\n\t\n    fn cos(self) -&gt; Num {\n        Value::from(self.cos(), -self.eps * self.eps.sin())\n    }\n}\n\nfn diff(func: |Num| -&gt; Num, x0: f64) -&gt; f64 {\n    let x = Num::from(x0, 1.0);\n    func(x).eps\n}\n\n// Usage: diff(|x| x.cos(), PI);\n\nThe way to make this work is that on calling solve(), the solver evaluates the solution at every point in the domain by constructing a Taylor polynomial (of 10th-order default); if the point in question is evaluated via Taylor remainder theorem and found to be too inaccurate, then a new Taylor series approximation is constructed at that point using the best approximate values from the previous series (and automatic differentiation), and the evaluator uses that new Taylor series to solve for the remaining points.\n","id":"https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub/alt-de-solver/","title":"Alternate differential equation solver"},"https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub/app-plans/":{"body":"Note: all of these apps follow a core-frontend architecture.

To do this, we will use two derived equations from Schwarzschild spacetime:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 r}{ds^2} = -\\frac{M}{r^2} + \\frac{l^2}{r^3} - \\frac{3Ml^2}{r^4}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 \\phi}{ds^2} = -\\frac{2l}{r^3} \\frac{dr}{ds}\n$$\n(there is a third equation, $\\theta'' = 0$, but it's unnecessary to really mention it, as $\\theta$ is constant)\nWe derived the two above equations from the radial motion equation and the $p_\\phi$ constant of motion equation, and taking the derivative to get a second-order differential equation (which also fortunately cancels out the square roots and all the annoyances of squares appearing in derivative terms).\nHere, we use the affine parameter $s$ as a substitute for time $t$, because light in General Relativity doesn't really experience time as it moves. So $s$ is like a \"substitute\" for time that we can effectively consider time, just for a light ray instead of an ordinary massive particle.\nWe will integrate from time $t_0$, when the rays leave the camera, to time $t_f$, where we can arbitrarily set $t_f$. We want to then find the position vector $\\vec R(t)$ of the ray at $t_f$, or $\\vec R(t_f)$. If $|\\vec R(t_f)| &lt; 2M$, that means the ray vector is inside the event horizon, so we want to return a color of black. Otherwise, we sample the color of the patch of night sky the ray position vector hits. \nAlternatively, we can simply find the vector $\\vec W = \\vec R(t_r) - \\vec O$, where $\\vec W$ is the vector pointing from the origin (where the camera is) to the ray vector position. By converting it to Cartesian coordinates and then normalizing this vector, we have the $(x, y, z)$ coordinates of the ray vector position in terms of the camera's world unit sphere. Now this is where equirectangular textures come in handy, because we can then take those $(x, y, z)$ coordinates and find the $(u, v)$ coordinates of the world texture, from which we can sample the color. The formula is:\n$$\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\operatorname{atan2}(W_z, W_x)}{2\\pi}\n$$\n$$\nv = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\operatorname{arcsin}(W_y)}{\\pi}\n$$\nFor each pixel, we will repeat these steps - creating a ray, tracing the ray, and then finding the final color it outputs, and assigning that color to that pixel. Then, we will have our complete image of the black hole.\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{dr}{d\\phi}\\right)^2 = \\frac{r^4}{b^2} - \\left(1 - \\frac{r_s}{r}\\right) \\left(\\frac{r^4}{a^2} + r^2\\right)\n$$\nNow we take the limit as $m \\to 0$, therefore $a \\to \\infty$ and $b \\to \\infty$, so:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{dr}{d\\phi}\\right)^2 =  - \\left(1 - \\frac{r_s}{r}\\right)r^2\n$$\nWe take the derivative again to get a second-order differential equation that doesn't have a squared derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 r}{d\\phi^2} = \\frac{1}{2} r_s - r\n$$\n\nFor debugging, we want to use the standard Newtonian $a = -\\frac{GM}{r^2}$ equation to test.\nhttps://github.com/tyler-a-cox/black_hole_raytracer/tree/master\n","id":"https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub/black-hole-raytracing/","title":"Black hole raytracing"},"https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub/elara-array-api-plan/":{"body":"Design goals:\n\nA pure Rust library designed NOT for FFI, but for use from only Rust.\nMinimal set of features, leave more complex math/science functions (e.g. convolution, diff eq solvers) for elara-math to implement\nFAST - really really really optimized and fast!!!\n\n// Macros for convenient array creation up to 3D\n// However they are not recommended for array data\narr![1, 2, 3, 4];\narr![[1, 2], [3, 4]];\n\n// Explicit array creation\n// This is the *only* time data is allocated\nNdArray::new(your_vec);\nNdArray::arange(0..10);\n\n// methods\n// these either operate in-place\n// or don't perform any manipulations on the underlying\n// data (like the transpose function) to prevent \n// copying for efficiency\narr.dot(&amp;arr2);\narr.matmul(&amp;arr2);\narr.product();\narr.len();\n\n// Operations default to in-place ops to prevent additional\n// copying or moves of data\narr + arr2;

First, we calculate $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta \\right) + \\gamma + \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\phi \\right) = \\pi\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma = \\theta + \\phi\n$$\nThen, we calculate $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\gamma\n$$\nThen, we calculate $\\omega$:\n$$\n\\omega + \\theta + \\alpha = \\pi\n$$\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\phi\n$$\nFinally, we can calculate $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\beta + \\alpha + (\\pi - \\omega) = \\pi\n$$\n$$\n\\beta = \\theta + 2\\phi\n$$\nWe can now say that $\\beta = \\theta_{i + 1}$, as it would be the value of $\\theta$ for the next bounce, and the whole setup would repeat. From there, we obtain the equation:\n$$\n\\theta_{i + 1} = \\theta_i + 2\\phi_i\n$$\nHowever, this equation continually increases, whereas what we want is for $\\theta_n = 0$ as we want planar waves. Thus, we add a small correction:\n$$\n\\theta_{i + 1} = \\theta_i + 2\\phi_i\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_{i + 1} = \\phi_i - i \\epsilon\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is a suitably small angle. Using this, we find that the resulting curve of $\\phi(x)$ is a curve whose derivative is a straight line, and therefore:\n$$\nf(x) = ax^2\n$$\nUsing $f(10) = 6$ obtained from the equation, we solve for the value $a = \\frac{50}{3}$. Therefore, the mathematically ideal surface is a surface of revolution about the x-axis of the curve:\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{3}{50} x^2\n$$\n\n","id":"https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub/focusing-chamber-1/","title":"Focusing chamber theoretical analysis 1"},"https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub/funny/":{"body":"\"Our weird bell thing\" - our new official name for the focusing chamber\n","id":"https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub/funny/","title":"Project humour and jokes"},"https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub/future-extensions/":{"body":"The following includes a number of ideas that may make their way into the project at some point in the future.\nSpaceplanes\nA new way to create SSTO-like transport spaceplanes:\n\nLift becomes insufficient ~30km into atmosphere\nSo we will design a jet (turbofan) engine that will transition to a ramjet, and then turn off at 30km, and rely on external rocket boosters the rest of the way\n\nA modified version of the aircraft can be launched from an electromagnetic catapult and does not need the turbofan; it can just use its ramjet\n\n\nThe external rocket boosters then detach (for this concept design they are non-reusable, but they are relatively cheap and inexpensive because they don't need to be as big as a typical rocket given they are given a head start by the jet engine)\nIf the spaceplane is configured for suborbital mode, then its payload (with attached third stage) is released at this point; if the spaceplane is configured for pure orbital mode (such as docking with ISS or an interplanetary spacecraft in orbit), then its rocket boosters burn for a little while longer\nUpon re-entry the SSTO would slow down in the upper atmosphere, then glide, then finally at ~5-10km altitude it turns its jet engine back on to fly to its runway\n\nWhy do this? It integrates the best things about both SSTOs and conventional rockets:\n\nAbility to operate from runways rather than extremely complex rocket launch pads\nTheoretically safer than conventional rocket (given it takes off like a normal jet) and cheaper than (non-reusable) rockets\nIsn't as limited by payload constraints of SSTOs because it uses lift and efficient jet engines to gain speed at low altitudes, then uses expendable rockets for the second stage - in fact it should be able to carry more payload than a comparable 2-stage rocket given the boosting effect of the jet engine at low altitudes, allowing the second stage expendable boosters to be smaller\nIt works well with economies of scale, which is the best way to achieve inexpensive spaceflight\n\nActive cooling for reentry systems to prevent need for thermal tiling.\nEngine stages:\n\nTakeoff-Cruise: turbofan with afterburner (or alternatively electromagnetic catapult, it must get to 300 km/h or above for its ramjet to work)\nCruise-15km: ramjet\n15km-70km: scramjet, from 30km onwards boosted by rocket\n\nThe same intake is used by both the turbofan and ram/scramjet. However, the air from the intake is rerouted to the appropriate engine at the appropriate stage.\nElara-powered vertical farms\nVertical farms that use hydroponics for massively increased food growth efficiency, to feed the world.\nElara-powered water splitting\n\nProject elara - using photosynthetic water splitting into H2 and O2 to make rocket fuel (LH2 and LOX)\nIdea: ion engines powered by hydrogen fuel cells are used for second-generation elara arrays\nIdea: project elara can store a lot of energy for peak demand times by using electrolysis to split water into hydrogen gas which can be then burned to generate electricity via steam turbines and generators (fuel cells work too but are less efficient) and the resulting water vapour collected and condensed during peak demand\n\nFuel-efficient airplanes\nThese are blended wing bodies with very very high lift-to-drag ratios (up to 600:1). So they can quickly take off to a high altitude (with high-thrust engines), then turn off their engines and just glide to their destination. This allows them to take advantage of jet streams in Earth's upper atmosphere and use minimal fuel.\nMass driver propulsion\nThe idea is to have two mass drivers that accelerate solid spherical fuel pellets so fast that when they hit each other the pellets vaporize. The mass drivers would be powered by nuclear reactors.\nOberth effect launches\nFor interplanetary missions in project elara, the standard practice is to let a spacecraft perform a powered fall into a gravity well to gain speed.\n$$\nK = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dK}{dt} = mv \\frac{dv}{dt} = mav = F v\n$$\n$$\nV = \\Delta v \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2v_{esc}}{\\Delta v}}\n$$\nThus with a delta-v of 100 km/s as can be accomplished with very long firings of an ion engine, then you can get to as much as 360 km/s. That being said, the ion engine would need to be fired for decades to get to actually get to 100 km/s from rest. Thus, conventional chemical engines with a high enough delta-v would work as well, as would a nuclear thermal engine (which should be able to run for much longer and thus have a high delta-v)\nMagsail in interstellar medium\nBlack hole reactor\nNon rotating black hole - Dyson array around it to extract mass-energy of accretion disk - can extract 6% mass energy. Method of simulating this would be to conduct an N-body simulation of millions of particles distributed randomly within a defined accretion disk with my geodesic integrator and finding the average particle flux around a Gaussian surface around the BH. Then use the flux distribution to find the optimal placement and geometry of the black hole mirror array.\nPlan for black hole spacecraft: it will be a photonic rocket powered by a black hole reactor. The black hole reactor uses a microscopic rotating black hole to which a tiny but constant stream of fuel is supplied. A dyson sphere envelops the black hole (which also serves as a magnetic cage). The black hole converts up to 29% of the mass-energy of the fuel to energy - that means 1 kg of fuel would be able to release $9 \\times 10^{16}$ Joules of energy - which can then be used to power a conventional thermal rocket or mass driver for spacecraft propulsion.\nDerivation: the maximum energy that can be extracted from a rotational black hole is given by:\n$$\nE_{max} = Mc^2 \\left[1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{M^2}}\\right)^{1/2}\\right]\n$$\nThe total energy efficiency is given by:\n$$\n\\lim_{a \\to 1} \\frac{E_{max}}{Mc^2} \\approx 0.29\n$$\nSSTOs\nIdea is for spaceplane with detachable rocket boosters. The spaceplane uses a ramjet up to about 20km of altitude, then shuts off its ramjet and uses its rocket boosters to quickly and rapidly gain thrust before the boosters detach and fall back to earth (they land with parachutes and big airbags, like pathfinder). This allows its main rocket engine and thrusters to be fairly small.\nHigh thrust, high delta-v propulsion\nHigh thrust, high delta-v rockets are rockets that both produce enough thrust and can run for a long time, from months to years on end. This excludes chemical rockets (which cannot run for long) and electrical propulsion (which produces too little thrust). The ones primarily investigated are:\n\nMass driver propulsion\nThermal rocket\nAntimatter rocket\nPlasma/other magnetohydrodynamic rocket\n\nNote: of interest also is interstellar magsail designs\nMethods to reduce nuclear waste\n\nFission-catalyzed fusion\nArtificial nuclear transmutation\n\n","id":"https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub/future-extensions/","title":"Speculative future extensions"},"https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub/geometrized/":{"body":"Refer to the following table for conversions from the SI system of units to the geometrized unit system.

If disabled, they will simply use println! instead.\n\nStandard library architecture\nAbove all else, project elara libraries (not apps!) should aim for minimalism and simplicity, in the style of tinygrad. Where more features and more code isn't necessary, it's not written, or it's an optional feature. This does mean users need to write more code to compensate for things libraries don't themselves do, but it also gives the user a lot more control. The idea is the project elara libraries should never be giant megaframeworks like React.js or TensorFlow.\nTo do this, project elara libraries rely on the idea of implementation-agnostic code and backends. E.g. elara-ui does not come with a backend. There is, however, a few simple lines of boilerplate code that users can easily add to use elara-gfx as the backend. This allows elara-ui to have no dependencies (other than the optional logger). Usage would be like this:\nuse elara_ui::prelude::*;\nuse elara_gfx::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n\t// elara-gfx boilerplate...\n\tlet rect_renderer = RectRenderer::new();\n\tlet line_renderer = LineRenderer::new();\n\tlet text_renderer = TextRenderer::new();\n\n\tlet ui = UI::new();\n\tui.set_layout(5, 5, 5, 8);\n\tlabel = Label::new(\"Hi!\");\n\tui.add_element(label)\n\t// ui stuff...\n\n\tlet frame = ui.render();\n\tfor el in frame.iter() {\n\t\tmatch el {\n\t\t\tComponent::Button =&gt; {\n\t\t\t\ttext_renderer.draw([10, 5], 50, 0, 5);\n\t\t\t\tline_renderer.draw(50, 60, 1, false);\n\t\t\t\t// etc.\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nSimilarly, elara-ml doesn't have a backend either (though it does have an optional feature flag that gives it a CPU backend implementation that uses both elara-math and elara-array). The library docs give more examples of possible implementations, and custom backends can be written for elara-ml as well, which would probably be useful for custom machine learning hardware in the future.\nelara-math also doesn't have a backend - this allows its autodiff, integration, diff eq solvers, and special functions to work regardless of what backend provides the backing array.\nThe only library for which this mostly doesn't apply is elara-array, which comes with a built-in CPU and GPU backend by default (though the GPU backend is behind an optional feature flag). This is because elara-array itself is a very minimal library anyways, and all it implements is a n-dimensional array that supports elementwise operations. In addition, its CPU and GPU backends together only have 3 dependencies.\nelara-astro\nhttps://crates.io/crates/nyx-space\nelara-md\nelaramd is a self-contained markdown to PDF converter for project elara.

However, widgets are not customizable\nThe component API provides basic building blocks of UIs that can then be joined together. They are flexible while not being overly verbose.\nThe draw API allows painting custom widgets. It is the lowest-level API.\n\nElara UI requirements:\n\nImplementation of the entire Elara UI design system\nGood performance, low footprint (but it does not have to be aggressively optimized)\nSimple to use and easy to maintain\nBattle-tested: to prove this, several apps meant for production use will be written in Elara UI to test its functionality (see the demo apps below)\n\nThe single biggest inspiration for Elara UI's API is Gtk.\nFor Elara UI apps, the primary architecture will be a core-frontend approach. The functionality of the app will reside in the core, essentially library that contains all app functions. This allows the app to be run from the terminal, as well as controlled by scripting. The core should be able to do everything the app needs to do. Meanwhile, the frontend will communicate with the core and present the interface that the user will use to control the app. However, the frontend has no functionality of its own; all the functionality is in the core, which the frontend merely provides an interface to.\nTo integrate with this architecture, Elara UI is a retained-mode UI library, and uses the simplest API imaginable:\n// 1. Create UI\nlet mut ui = UI::new(1600, 1200);\n\n// 2. Create layouts\nlet mut left_sidebar = Layout::default();\n\n// 3. Add elements with widgets API (easier) or \n// components API (more control) to layout\nlet mut sidebar_label = Label::new(\"Sidebar\");\nlet mut sidebar_list = List::from(\"Item {}\", 0..5);\n\n// 4. Add callbacks to widgets to make them interactive\n// widgets can be bound to a state so that their appearance\n// is linked to that state\nsidebar_list.on(move |event| {\n    match event {\n        Event::Click =&gt; {\n            ui.close();\n        },\n        _ =&gt; (),\n    }\n})\n\n// 5. Add components to layout, and add layout to UI\nleft_sidebar.add_element(sidebar_label);\nleft_sidebar.add_element(sidebar_list);\nui.add_element(left_sidebar);\n\nTesting demo apps:\n\nMake an analogue of https://sindresorhus.com/plain-text-editor\nMake a gui version of https://pypi.org/project/share-file-qr/\nMake a previewer/slide shower based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method like sent from the suckless project\nMake a basic demo terminal based on https://github.com/dhanoosu/TkTerm\n\nFollow tips from https://2d.graphics/\nTips for fast GPU rendering:\n\nOnly render on user input/interaction, otherwise don't re-render frames (no immediate-mode UI that re-renders every frame)\nOnly re-render changed areas (\"damage tracking\")\n\nThis requires caching the last render to a texture in memory and loading that texture on next frame, cropping out the region that was changed\n\n\nMust render on GPU\nFor repeated elements (e.g. long lists or tree views) caching is necessary\n\ndesign stuff:\nFor elaraui components - implement all the components that egui has in its demo\nElara UI should support a unified theme framework like https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Themes. Config specifies whether a theme is light or dark, and then specifies the colors of the theme. The Elara Design demo app can be used to preview the colors, and there is also an editor to visually edit themes. The Rust version of Elara UI (from which all the other versions are built from) will ship with a number of themes by default.\nCool apps to maybe port one day to elara-ui as demo applications:\n\nhttps://github.com/FPurchess/blank\nhttps://github.com/adileo/squirreldisk\nhttps://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive\nhttps://github.com/kkoomen/pointless\n\nelara-math\nImplement the following:\n\nAdam optimizer\n\nCurrent progress: see [Elara math optimization plan]\nElara-math will use elara-array for implementation of n-dimensional arrays, however everything else (e.g. diff eq solvers, FFT, special functions, quadrature, etc.) is custom-implemented.\nIn the future, do a \"blank rewrite\" - rewriting the entire library without looking at any reference github source code. Doing this often will help improve the code quality.\nAutodiff implementations to look at:\n\nhttps://github.com/ziap/autodiff/\nhttps://github.com/matiasbattocchia/simple-grad\nhttps://github.com/conradludgate/autograd-rs/tree/main\n(Nearly 1-1 reimplementation of Jax in Rust) https://getcode.substack.com/p/beyond-backpropagation-higher-order\n\nIn the future elara-math should have a second functional API like Jax's that will be the primary API. This functional API has a elara_math::grad()function that transforms one function into a corresponding function for its derivative. Base this on how https://github.com/HIPS/autograd implements it. This is bc the current PyTorch-inspired API is basically only good for neural networks and wastes computational time creating graphs. One similar rust implementation to reference is https://github.com/ibab/rust-ad/blob/master/src/lib.rs.\nImplement sparse matrices: https://crates.io/crates/sprs\n\n\nAlso add a numerical quadrature feature to elara-math to compute integrals:\n\nImplement simpson's rule and Gauss-Konrod rule based on https://github.com/esa/torchquad for 1D case, Monte-Carlo integration for N-D case, as well as Trapezoidal and Romberg quadrature for integrating over discrete arrays\n\nAdd automatic integration - this is like automatic differentiation, only it takes a function and integrates its nth Taylor polynomial (which can be found exactly) - since unlike typical numerical integration it can be done to machine precision and thus doesn't suffer from numerical precision errors, it could be far more precise\n\nNote: for this approach, automatic differentiation is necessary to compute the values of the derivative to construct the Taylor series\nTechniques similar to Gauss-Konrod quadrature will probably be necessary to do range reduction for this approach to work well\n\n\n\nhttps://crates.io/crates/quad-rs/0.1.2\nAlso learn matrix calculus for elara-math from https://www.lesswrong.com/s/nMGrhBYXWjPhZoyNL/p/9L9XuXhLYBm47yYkf\nAlso eventually create a tensor algebra system like cadabra: https://cadabra.science/\nAlso add a monte-carlo solver for ODEs: https://jotterbach.github.io/content/posts/mc_ode/2018-08-08-MonteCarloODE/\nelara-ml\nNote: Elara ML is responsible for implementing the higher-level constructs for efficient machine learning (e.g. dense layers, convolution layers, model architectures, pretrained models, etc.) while Elara Math handles the underlying computations.\nSee [Elara ML API proposal]\nelara-ml goals:\n\nCorrect: a model written in PyTorch or TensorFlow should make equivalent predictions when ported to elara-ml\nComprehensible: source code is in idiomatic Rust with lots of comments\nMinimal: only the features you really need\nEfficient: works fast, handles errors gracefully, and has an API with good developer experience, such as model.summary() visualizations (and isn't error-prone or overly verbose). It should also have good UI - e.g. progress bars on training.\n\nFor elara-ml instead of a vec of two tensors (the weights and the biases) which is wasteful in terms of memory, it would be more efficient to just iterate separately on the weights and biases. So instead of:\nfor t in self.parameters().iter() {\n\tt.update(lr);\n}\n\ninstead do:\nfor t in self.weights().iter() {\n\tt.update(lr);\n}\n\nfor t in self.biases().iter() {\n\tt.update(lr);\n}\n\nAlso elara-ml should have dedicated Input and Output layers - they are basically normal Linear layers with a type alias, but they greatly improve in preventing errors in models.\nelara-ml should have both tests verifying correctness in code and in functionality. That is, part of its tests should be various neural networks that take in a random number of input features and labels (of different shapes, e.g. 500x3, 1x8, etc.) and should be able to predict the same features and labels with minimal configuration correctly at every point.\nhttps://github.com/utility-code/tinyDL\nelara-gfx\nSee [Elara GFX continuing work]\nFixes:\n\n\nFix the issue of the text rendering coordinates\n\nUnified coordinate system for all primitives\n\nFeatures:\n\n\nPreliminary UI rendering\n\nSave OpenGL rendering to image file for headless rendering (see this)\n\nFor a demo of both elara-array and elara-gfx - port the following pathtracers to Rust using only the project elara libraries:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/li-plus/tinypt\n\nhttp://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/\n\nhttps://github.com/vkoskiv/c-ray\n\nThe raytracing series\n\n\n\nLook at https://lodev.org/lodepng/ and port the 500-line picoPNG into a Rust version for elara-gfx.\nImplement several libraries on top of elara-gfx:\n\nelara-vg: Fabric.js/Paper.js-like vector graphics library on top of elara-gfx, see http://fabricjs.com/fabric-intro-part-1, basically it implements the vector graphics parsing and processing and vector graphics operations, but it leaves all the rendering to elara-gfx, which allows it to render to any platform elara-gfx supports (basically all the platforms)\nelara-ui: minimal UI library on top of elara-gfx used for all the Elara apps, again thanks to the library it supports all the platforms elara-gfx supports (further details below)\n\nhttps://zed.dev/blog/videogame\nelara-gfx is meant to not include mathematical operations. However, for certain operations that do require handling arrays, elara-gfx will have a micro-implementation of basic math using purely functional programming. That means function signatures will look like this:\n// Takes in matrix a of dims (M x N) and matrix b of dims (N x K)\n// and write the result to matrix c\nfn matmul(a: &amp;[f64], b: &amp;[f64], m: usize, n: usize, k: usize, c: &amp;mut [f64]);\n\nelara-gfx should have three main APIs:\n\nGfxRenderer, which is common graphics rendering layer like SDL (just with the ability to render both on the CPU and the GPU)\nGPUCompute, which is an OpenGL wrapper for GPU computations (like CUDA), inspired by this\nPlatform, a very low-level API to do things like window creation, event listening, etc.\n\nAgain, it aims to eventually be zero-dependency, which means that you do need to write OpenGL boilerplate initialization code yourself.\nCrucially elara-gfx should not implement any math functions. That is what elara-math and elara-array does.\nThe GfxRenderer layer is able to draw basically anything graphics-related: \n\nLines\nPrimitives\n\nRectangles\nCircles\nTriangles\n\n\nText\nImages\n\nTypical textures\nOptionally images created procedurally using elara-gfx shaders\n\nThe shaders are Rust closures that take in 32-bit vertex data and fragment data as input and output a 32-bit raster image\nThis means theoretically the shaders can render anything (even 3D objects or scenes)\nHowever since the shaders are CPU-based they are slow, the OpenGL canvas is faster and should be used for intensive rendering tasks\n\n\n\n\nAny 2D curve of arbitrary stroke and line color given a set of vertices\nAny 2D shape of arbitrary stroke and fill given a set of vertices (which means e.g. if you want to draw a bezier curve, you need to write your algorithm to convert it to an array of vertices)\nOpenGL canvas (GPU only, can run arbitrary OpenGL drawing commands)\n\nThis means that to use elara-gfx is as simple as declaring:\nuse elara_gfx::{GfxRenderer, RenderBackend};\n\nfn main() {\n    // use the cross-platform CPU backend\n    // the backend is kind of like https://zserge.com/posts/fenster/\n    let ctx = GfxRenderer::create_ctx(RenderBackend::CPU);\n    ctx.draw(...);\n\n    // use the cross-platform OpenGL backend\n    let ctx = GfxRenderer::create_ctx(RenderBackend::OpenGL);\n    ctx.draw(...);\n\n    // use the Apple-only Metal backend\n    let ctx = GfxRenderer::create_ctx(RenderBackend::Metal);\n    ctx.draw(...);\n\n    // use the cross-platform Image backend\n    // this is most suitable to rendering to an image like a PNG\n    let ctx = GfxRenderer::create_ctx(RenderBackend::Image);\n    ctx.draw(...);\n}\n\nElara GFX should eventually be zero-dependency (other than elara-log, but even that should be an optional feature flag), like space-shooter.c/tigr. This is a very long-term thing.\nTo implement this, I can make a simplified port of tigr to C with just the OpenGL parts, and then port it to Rust for a zero-dependency GL/platforming library. This is in line with the long-term goal of making the entire Elara Project zero-dependency.\nelara-array\nMore details in [Elara-array API plan]\nelara-array should include its GPU backend as an optional feature. This speeds up compile times - because if it doesn't use the GPU backend, it has basically zero dependencies.\nImplement the following:\n\n\nWorking differential equations solvers\n\nWorking pretty-print for NdArrays\n\nWorking 1D pretty print\n\nPython bindings (referencing tinynumpy for the code)\n\nNanoserde serialization to JSON for NumPy bridge\n\nTests for the library\n\nReplace ndarray-rand with nanorand\n\nelara-plot\nCan plot 2D real and complex-valued functions, 3D functions, and 4D functions, as well as their field equivalents.\nCan also plot parametric lines and parametric surfaces, as well as vector-valued functions and vector fields\nVisualizing 4D functions $f(\\mathbb{R}^3) \\to \\mathbb{R}^4$: assign a color to each point in 3D space (density plots), such as:\n\nhttps://www.math.brown.edu/tbanchof/multivarcalc2/multivarcalc3-1.html\nhttp://www.falstad.com/qmatom/\n\n","id":"https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub/library-plans/","title":"Project Elara library plans"},"https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub/markdown-guide/":{"body":"The Elara Hub uses a special formatting language to generate its website.

They can be noted with $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$ or $f_x$. The formal definition of the partial derivative in 2D is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h, y) - f(x, y)}{h}\n$$\nMixed partial derivatives\nSecond partial derivatives are denoted by $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}$ or $f_{xx}$. When using the \"del\" notation (with the $\\partial$ symbol) you take derivatives from right to left order; when using the subscript notation, you take derivatives from left to right order.\nSecond partial derivatives commute, which means the order you take them doesn't matter. Thus $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y \\partial x}$.\nThe nabla symbol\nThe nabla symbol $\\nabla$ represents a \"vector\" of partial derivative operators:\n$$\n\\nabla = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\right\\rangle\n$$\nScalar-valued functions\nA scalar-valued function is a function that always outputs a number for each input, not a vector, such as $f(x, y) = 2x + 3y^2$.\nGradients\nThe gradient of a scalar-valued function, denoted $\\nabla f$, is given by a vector containing all the partial derivatives of the function. In two dimensions, it is given by:\n$$\n\\nabla f(x, y) = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\right\\rangle\n$$\nIn three dimensions, it is similarly given by:\n$$\n\\nabla f(x, y, z) = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThe gradient can be evaluated at a point $(x, y, z)$ by evaluating each of the partial derivatives at that point\nDirectional derivative\nThe directional derivative is the rate of change along a specific vector $\\vec v$ and is given by:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\vec v} , f = \\nabla f \\cdot \\vec v\n$$\nMultivariable chain rule\nIf we have a function $f(g(t))$, then:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\frac{dt}{dt} = \\nabla f(g(t)) \\cdot g'(t)\n$$\nParametric surfaces\nJust as there can be surfaces formed by functions of $x$ and $y$, there can be parametric surfaces formed by functions of $s$ and $t$. They are denoted $f(s, t)$ and can be differentiated in the same way as normal surfaces, i.e. $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial s}$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}$.\nVector-valued functions\nVector-valued functions produce a vector for each input, for instance:\n$$\n\\vec f(t) = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\nt^2 + 2t \\\n\\sin(2t) + t\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNote that vector-valued functions can have components that are functions of $x, y, z$, or functions of $t$, in which case its components are parametric functions.\nThe derivative of a vector-valued function is another vector in all cases. For example, velocity is often given by a vector-valued function where:\n$$\n\\vec v(t) = \\begin{bmatrix}\nv_x(t) \\\nv_y(t) \\\nv_z(t)\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\nx'(t) \\\ny'(t) \\\nz'(t)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nSpeed is given by the norm of the velocity function:\n$$\nv = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}\n$$\nIf the vector-valued function is of one variable, e.g. $\\vec v(t)$, then its derivative is a regular derivative $\\frac{d \\vec v}{dt}$. If the vector-valued function is of several variables, e.g. $\\vec v(s, t)$, then it has one partial derivative for each variable, e.g. $\\frac{\\partial \\vec v}{\\partial s}$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\vec v}{\\partial t}$.\nThe same methodology for vector-valued functions applies to vector fields.\nCurvature\nThe curvature $\\kappa$ of a vector-valued function $\\vec v(t)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{|d \\vec T|}{|ds|} = \\frac{\\vec v'(t)}{| v'(t)|}\n$$\nwhere the double bars indicate normalizing the vector.\nVector fields and scalar fields\nFields are mathematical objects that span space and have a unique value at each point in space. Familiar examples include the electromagnetic field and gravitational field. They are written with the same notation as functions, just usually with a different symbol such as $E$, $B$, $g$ or $\\phi$.\nScalar fields, such as temperature, assign a number to each point in space. Vector fields assign a vector to each point in space. A gradient is only defined for a scalar field - the vector-field equivalent of the gradient for vector fields is called the Jacobian, and will be covered later.\nDivergence\nDivergence, denoted by $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec F$, represents the tendency of a vector field to flow out or in to a certain point:\n\nIf vectors that point inwards towards a certain point are bigger than vectors that point outwards at that point, the divergence is negative and we have a sink\nIf vectors that point inwards towards a certain point are smaller than vectors that point outwards at that point, the divergence is positive and we have a source\nIf vectors that point inwards and vectors that point outwards at a certain point are equal in size, the divergence is zero\n\nThe divergence of a vector field $\\vec F$ with components $\\langle F_x, F_y, F_z\\rangle$ is given by:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec F = \\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial z}\n$$\nDivergence is only defined on vector fields, not on scalar fields.\nCurl\nCurl, denoted by $\\nabla \\times \\vec F$, represents the tendency of a vector field to rotate around a certain point:\n\nPositive curl is a tendency of vectors to rotate counterclockwise around a point\nNegative curl is a tendency of vectors to rotate clockwise around a point\nZero curl is when counterclockwise and clockwise vectors cancel out or if the vectors do not rotate around a point\n\nIn 2D, the curl of a vector field is given by:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec F = \\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y}\n$$\nIn 3D, the curl of a vector field is the determinant of a 3 x 3 matrix:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec F = \n\\begin{vmatrix}\n\\hat i &amp; \\hat j &amp; \\hat k \\\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} &amp; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} &amp; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\\nF_x &amp; F_y &amp; F_z\n\\end{vmatrix}\n$$\nLaplacian\nThe Laplacian, denoted by $\\nabla^2 f$, is a vector field formed from the second derivatives of a scalar field. It is given by:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 f = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\nA function is called harmonic if it satisfies $\\nabla^2 f = 0$. This is a partial differential equation called Laplace's equation.\nJacobian\nThe Jacobian is the analogue of the gradient for vector-valued functions. For a vector-valued function $\\vec F$ with components $\\langle F_x, F_y \\rangle$, the Jacobian is given by:\n$$\nJ = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\nabla F_x \\\n\\nabla F_y\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial x} &amp; \\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y} \\\n\\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x} &amp; \\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial y}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nFor a vector valued function $\\vec F$ of three dimensions, the Jacobian is given by:\n$$\nJ =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial x} &amp; \\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y} &amp; \\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial z} \\\n\\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x} &amp; \\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial y} &amp; \\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial z} \\\n\\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial x} &amp; \\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial y} &amp; \\frac{\\partial F_z}{\\partial z}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of the Jacobian is calculated just like the determinant of any other matrix. The absolute value of the determinant of the Jacobian tells us about how areas change area around a point:\n\nIf the determinant is 1, the area remains the same area\nIf the determinant is less than 1, the area contracts\nIf the determinant is greater than 1, the area expands\nIf the determinant is 0, the area contracts infinitely\n\nTangent plane\nThe tangent plane is the local linear approximation to a function at a certain point. It is often used to simplify a complicated function when the area being studied is around a certain point.\nTangent plane (explicit functions)\nThe tangent plane to a function $f(x, y)$ at a point $(x_0, y_0)$ is given by:\n$$\nT(x, y) = f(x_0, y_0) + f_x (x_0, y_0) (x - x_0) + f_y (x_0, y_0) (y - y_0)\n$$\nTangent plane (implicit functions)\nThe implicit tangent plane to a function $f(x, y, z) = 0$ at a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is given by:\n$$\nf_x (x - x_0) + f_y(y - y_0) + f_z (z - z_0) = 0\n$$\n","id":"https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub/multivar/","title":"Multivariable calculus guide"},"https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub/outreach-plan/":{"body":"Fundamental issues:\n\nMust reach critical threshold of ~15-25 people to be able to start getting attention\nThen we can present our work to a larger audience (e.g. SPS, official events, etc.) and get more people to join\nWith a bigger team we can build more advanced prototypes and have more results that we can then use to recruit more people - positive feedback loop above critical threshold\nAlso other options:\n\n[Project Elara Visualization-based outreach]\nSoftware-based outreach (marketing the elara libraries as part of the project)\n\n\nHowever to get to 15-25 people we must use direct outreach\n\nUse DALL-E/Midjourney/Stable Diffusion to create youtube videos/website photos/poster images for Project Elara, and I'll compose the musical background music for the videos.\n","id":"https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub/outreach-plan/","title":"Project Elara Outreach Plan"},"https://elaraproject.github.io/elara-hub/project-philosophy/":{"body":"Project Elara is founded on a few key ideas.

This entails that the hands to steer the project must always be our own. The project is also designed to be resilient, to resist outside influences, and to be as self-sufficient as possible. It is not bound to any physical location, country, or government, all its software and hardware are free and open-source, and the project's main publications can all be read offline. In addition, we try to stay away from depending on large organizations - while we may not have as many resources, we can work with less bureaucracy hindering our progress.\nFinally, we want the project to be representative of all humanity.
